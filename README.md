# ML-Assignment-02-Python-Excerpt
 Python code mimicking different router scheduler types for a machine learning project.
 
 This code relied on work done together with a group member, so I have instead removed an excerpt from the original codebase that was exclusivly my own work. 
 
 This will not run on its own without the wider machine learning project, however I believe this code shows my solid understanding of object oriented software design, in particular the concept of inheritance.
 
 Scheduler.py is the superclass in which all the other scheduler classes are subclasses of.
